# Kinematic_Param_Calibration
This repo is for kinematic parameter calibration of an industrail manipulator.
Methods based on modified DH and POE will be covered.
Hand-eye calibration will be coded as well.

## TODO
[] Add more intensive test on hand-eye calibration
[] Finish robot_poe.update_poe function
    * rewrite fkine function in robot_poe, with all frame (tool frame and original frame) represented in twist
    * finish update function
