% We do not consider prismatic joints. All joints are revolute.
% The robot class should have an element that shows its joints' dh table
% type, marked by "S" for standard DH, "M" for modified DH.
% 
% The whole program is designed to work offline to avoid direct control for
% the robot.
% All the functions should be capable of processing data in parallel.
% (Fkine should be able to process multiple joint profiles at once)
%
%The robot class is based on class seriallink from Peter Corke's Robotic
%Toolbox.
